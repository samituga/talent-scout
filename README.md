```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

#### 2. Install the git hook scripts

pre-commit install
```

- run pre-commit install to set up the git hook scripts

## Cargo Dependencies

#### sqlx

<details>

#### 1. Install sqlx

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

#### 2. Prepare offline environment

Generate offline sql data (needs postgres to be running)\
sqlx calls into our database at compile-time to ensure that all queries can be successfully executed considering
the schemas of our tables.\
We use this command locally to save the results so that we don't need a live connection on the CI pipelines.\
We will need the env variable `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` to use the offline data

```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --all-targets
```

We can also use it locally

```bash
SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo run
```

</details>

## Local environment

Initialize the DB by executing the script

```bash
./scripts/compose-up.sh
```

It will execute the `docker compose up`, set up the app user and db and execute the DB migrations
